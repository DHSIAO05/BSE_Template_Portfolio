# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building the car chassis and getting all of my motors to work. I first started off building the car chassis, so screwing in the motors in and putting the rubber wheels. I needed to understand all of the components that were used such as the esp32, the motor drivers, and where all of the wirings should go. I first started with trying to get the two left wheels to work by plugging all of the wires from the esp32 to the motor driver. I then connected the wires from the motors to the motor drivers and plugged a battery pack to the driver yo power it. After, I checked my arduino code, making sure all of the inputs were correct so that the wheels would spin. I then did the same thing for the two right wheels and at first they spun the opposite direction from the two left wheels. I noticed that I had plugged in the wires incorrectly, but I managed to fix it. Finally, I put in the code for the two right wheels, making sure that I had all of my inputs correct corresponding to its wheels, and they all spun in sync.
